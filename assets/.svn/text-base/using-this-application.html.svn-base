    <h1>Using this Application</h1>

<h2>How often should I use the My Migraine Triggers<sup>™</sup> app?</h2>

<p class="text">Keeping track of your migraine symptoms and potential triggers can help your healthcare provider better diagnose and treat your 
migraines. Maintain a diary for at least one month, preferably more, to track the frequency of your headaches, their intensity, and whether or not they interfere with daily activities.<sup>1</sup> Even on days you don’t have a headache you should use this diary to log exposure to potential triggers. Print or email your diary and the accompanying charts and bring them to your next appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your migraine history. 
</p>

<h2>Can I add notes or additional 
information to my entries?</h2>
<p class="text">Yes, on the last page of the diary there is an opportunity to add notes for your entry. Also, <b>on many of the diary questions you can add your own answer</b> by 
selecting “Add your own answer” and typing in your desired answer. Your custom answer will now be available to you every time you make a diary entry.</p>

<h2>Can I edit an entry?</h2>
<p class="text">Yes, the confirmation screen after each entry will display the option “View Now” which will allow you to view and edit the entry you just completed. Also on the first page of the My Diary tab there is the option to “Edit a previous entry”.</p>

<h2>Can I filter the information I see in the charts and diary log?</h2>
<p class="text">Yes, when viewing the Diary Log, touch the filter icon in the lower left corner to select the 
categories and range of dates you would like to see. In Charts, the filter icon will allow you to select the range of dates you would like to see.</p>

<h2>How do I print or email my diary?</h2>
<p class="text">When you are viewing the Charts or the Diary Log touch the Share icon in the lower left corner. The next screen will allow you to select the range of dates you want to export and provides the 
opportunity to include only the charts, the Diary Log or both. You must have a wireless enabled printer that is compatible with the Google Cloud Print software to print directly from the app. Alternatively, email the information to a 
computer where you can print the information or email the charts and/or log directly to your 
healthcare provider.</p>

<h2>Do you share any of the information I put in the My Migraine Triggers<sup>™</sup> app?</h2>
<p class="text">No, all of the information you enter is stored on your phone. No one without physical access to your phone can retrieve your 
information.</p>

<h2>On the question "Are you experiencing any menstrual or pre-menstrual symptoms?" I selected "Don't ask me again." Is there a way to add that question back to My Diary?</h2>
<p class="text">Yes, Click “Settings” from the overflow menu on top. Toggle the “Ask about menstruation” button to ON. The question will show the question in the My Diary section.</p>
