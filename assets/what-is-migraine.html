    <h1>What is a Migraine?</h1>
    <p class="preface">
      A migraine is more than just a bad headache. 
      Migraine headaches are a neurological
      <span style="line-height:14px;">disorder characterized by imbalances in brain chemistry.<sup>1, 2</sup></span>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="text">
      Although the exact cause of migraine headaches isnâ€™t completely understood, medical researchers believe that migraine headaches are caused by 
      altered blood flow and abnormal levels of naturally-produced substances in the brain. 
      <br/><br/>
      When blood flow is decreased, certain arteries dilate and cause pain-producing chemicals to be released. Additionally, the dilation causes an increase in the natural substance levels. This makes the blood vessels lining the brain swell and creates pressure on nearby nerves. 
      <br/><br/>
      These nerves send pain signals to the body that are typically felt around the eye or temple region and can extend to the face, sinus, jaw, or neck.
